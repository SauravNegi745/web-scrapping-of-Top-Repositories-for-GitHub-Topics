<h1>Project Outline</h1>
<br>We're going to scrape https://github.com/topics</br>
<br>We'll get a list of topics. For each topic, we'll get topic title, topic page URL and topic description</br>
<br>For each topic, we'll get the top 25 repositories in the topic from the topic page</br>
<br>For each repository, we'll grab the repo name, username, stars and repo URL</br>
<br>For each topic we'll create a CSV file in the following format:</br>
<br>Repo Name,Username,Stars,Repo URL</br>
